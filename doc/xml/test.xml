        <p><backrest/> uses Docker to run tests and generate documentation.  Docker's light-weight virualization provides the a good balance between proper OS emulation and performance (especially startup)</p>

        <p>A Vagrantfile is provided that contains the complete configuration required to run <backrest/> tests and build documentation.  If Vagrant is not suitable then the Vagrantfile still contains the configuration steps required to build a test system.</p>

        <p>Note that this is not required for normal operation of <backrest/>.</p>

        <p>The easiest way to start testing <backrest/> is with the included Vagrantfile.</p>

        <code-block title="Build Vagrant and Logon">
            cd test
            vagrant up
            vagrant ssh
        </code-block>

        <p>The <code>vagrant up</code> step could take some time as a number of Docker containers must also be built.</p>
